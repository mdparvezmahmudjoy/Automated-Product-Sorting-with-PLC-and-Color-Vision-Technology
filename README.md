# Automated Product Sorting with Color Vision Technology
A demonstration of fundamental  Sorting line with using color sensor controller Project using Ladder Diagram (LAD) in Siemens TIA Portal for S7 PLCs.

# üìÅ Project Contents This repository contains:

1.Sorting line Project_S7_LAD (TIA Portal Project)

     Siemens project file with LAD logic implementations.

     Includes OBs, FBs, and DBs for structured programming. 

2.Sorting line Project-Model_Factory_IO

     Interactive 3D simulation model (compatible with Factory I/O).

     Visualizes PLC logic in an industrial automation context.

3.Schematic Sorting line Project.pdf

     PDF documentation of the program structure and logic flow.

     Annotated ladder diagrams for easy reference. 
     
4. Demo Video Sorting line Project.mp4

     Step-by-step walkthrough of project operations.

     Shows real-time responses to input triggers.

# üõ†Ô∏è Requirements Software:

       Siemens TIA Portal (V16 or later).

       Factory I/O (optional, for 3D simulation). 

#   Hardware:
      Compatible S7 PLC (e.g., S7-1200/S7-1500) or PLCSIM Advanced for virtual testing.
